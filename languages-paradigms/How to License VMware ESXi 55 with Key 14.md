## Step 1: Obtain the License Key
 
To obtain the license key for ESXi 5.5, you need to have an active support and subscription (SnS) contract with VMware. If you have one, you can log in to the Customer Connect Portal and go to the License Keys page. There, you can find the key 14 for ESXi 5.5 under the Data Center Virtualization and Cloud Infrastructure section. You can also upgrade your existing license keys from previous versions of ESXi to 5.5 by following the instructions in this article[^2^].
 
## Step 2: Add the License Key to vSphere Client
 
To add the license key to vSphere Client, you need to connect to the vCenter Server that manages your ESXi host. If you don't have a vCenter Server, you can connect directly to the ESXi host using vSphere Client. Note that older versions of vCenter Server cannot manage newer versions of ESXi, so make sure you have vCenter Server 5.5 or later.
 
Once you are connected, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Home.
2. Under the Administration section, click the Licensing icon.
3. Click Manage vSphere Licenses.
4. Enter the License Key in the Enter new vSphere license keys field (one per line).
5. Include labels for new license keys as necessary.
6. Click Add License Keys.
7. Review the license keys you added, capacity counts, expiration dates, and labels associated with the license keys.
8. Click Next to assign the license keys.

## Step 3: Assign the License Key to ESXi Host
 
To assign the license key to ESXi host, follow these steps:

1. Choose Evaluation Mode and expand the list.
2. Find the ESXi host you want to license.
3. Right-click on the host and click Change License Key.
4. Select Assign a new license key to this host.
5. Select key 14 from the list that was entered previously on Manage License window.
6. Click OK.

Congratulations! You have successfully licensed VMware ESXi 5.5 with key 14. You can now enjoy all the features of ESXi 5.5 without any limitations.
  
## Step 4: Verify the License Status
 
To verify the license status of your ESXi host, you can use the vSphere Client or the esxcli command line tool. To use the vSphere Client, follow these steps:

1. Click Home.
2. Under the Administration section, click the Licensing icon.
3. Select the ESXi host from the list.
4. Check the License Status column. It should show Licensed if the license key is valid and applied correctly.

To use the esxcli command line tool, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the ESXi host using SSH or the console.
2. Run this command: `esxcli software vib list | grep -i base`
3. Check the License column. It should show VMware-vSphere-Standard if the license key is valid and applied correctly.
