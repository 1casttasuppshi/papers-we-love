# How to Edit Your Save Games in Game Dev Tycoon
 
Game Dev Tycoon is a simulation game where you create and manage your own video game company. You can choose your genre, platform, features, staff, and more. But what if you want to tweak some aspects of your game or company that are not available in the game options? That's where a save game editor comes in handy.

A save game editor is a tool that allows you to modify your save files and change various values, such as your money, fans, staff skills, research points, and more. However, using a save game editor is not officially supported by Greenheart Games, the developers of Game Dev Tycoon. This means that if you encounter any bugs or glitches after editing your save file, you are on your own. You also risk breaking the balance and challenge of the game by cheating.
 
That being said, if you still want to try editing your save games in Game Dev Tycoon, there are some options available. One of them is a Java Save Game Editor created by a user named HeWhoWas on the Greenheart Games Forum[^1^]. This editor supports both Steam and Standalone installations of the game (but you need to disable Cloud Sync for Steam). It allows you to edit your company name, cash, fans, data, staff factors, and more. You can download it from this link: https://bitbucket.org/HeWhoWas/gdtedit-rewrite/downloads
 
To use this editor, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Close the game.
2. Run the editor.
3. Load the default database or browse for your save file location.
4. Edit the values you want. If a text field is red, it hasn't been written yet. Move off of a field to trigger a write.
5. Save the database when you are done.
6. Run the game and enjoy your changes.

Another option is a web-based Save Game Editor created by a user named TheGamingChannel on the Steam Community[^3^]. This editor allows you to view your stats and save your changes to the Cloud. You can access it from this link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/239820/discussions/0/648814844716951969/?l=english
 
To use this editor, you need to follow these steps:

1. Close the game.
2. Go to the link above and log in with your Steam account.
3. Select your save file from the list or upload it manually.
4. Edit the values you want.
5. Save your changes and download the modified save file.
6. Replace your original save file with the modified one in your game folder.
7. Run the game and enjoy your changes.

Please note that these editors are not official tools and may not work properly with newer versions of the game or with mods installed. Use them at your own risk and make sure to backup your original save files before editing them. Also, please respect the work of Greenheart Games and do not use these editors to pirate or distribute their game illegally.
  
Some of the benefits of using a save game editor are:

- You can customize your game to suit your preferences and play style. For example, you can increase your money if you want to buy more features or platforms, or you can increase your fans if you want to boost your sales and reputation.
- You can experiment with different choices and outcomes without having to replay the whole game. For example, you can change your genre, target audience, or engine and see how it affects your reviews and sales.
- You can fix some bugs or glitches that may occur in your game. For example, you can restore your lost data or progress if your save file gets corrupted or deleted.
- You can have more fun and challenge by creating your own scenarios or goals. For example, you can set yourself a limit on how much money you can spend or earn, or you can try to create the best or worst game possible.

However, there are also some drawbacks and risks of using a save game editor, such as:

- You may lose the original challenge and balance of the game by cheating. For example, you may make the game too easy or boring by giving yourself unlimited resources or skills.
- You may encounter unexpected errors or crashes in your game after editing your save file. For example, you may break some scripts or events that depend on certain values or conditions.
- You may violate the terms of service or license agreement of the game by modifying your save file. For example, you may infringe on the intellectual property rights of Greenheart Games or other developers.
- You may lose the respect and support of the game developers and community by cheating. For example, you may be banned from online features or forums, or you may receive negative feedback from other players.

Therefore, before using a save game editor, you should weigh the pros and cons carefully and decide whether it is worth it for you. You should also respect the work and vision of Greenheart Games and other developers who created Game Dev Tycoon and its mods. Remember that using a save game editor is not officially supported by Greenheart Games and is done at your own risk.
